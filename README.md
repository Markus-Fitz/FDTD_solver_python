# Finite difference time domain solver for Maxwell's equations.

With this project I aim to create a simple and light-weight numerical solver for Maxwell's equations.
This solver is initially an educational project first which preferres explicit expression over elegance and performance. It will be optimized as much as it can be in this context, though other implementations in different languages will most likely follow.
