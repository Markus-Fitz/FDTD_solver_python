# Finite difference time domain solver for Maxwell's equations.

This project's aim is to create a simple and light-weight numerical solver for Maxwell's equations.

This solver is an educational project first, which preferres explicit expression over elegance and performance. It will be optimized as much as it can be in this context, though other implementations in different languages may follow for that.
